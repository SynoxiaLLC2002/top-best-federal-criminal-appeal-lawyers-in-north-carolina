        <h2>Understanding Federal Criminal Appeals</h2>
        <h3>What is a Federal Criminal Appeal?</h3>
        <p>A federal criminal appeal is a request to a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. It is not a retrial but an examination of whether legal errors occurred during the original trial that could have affected the outcome. Common grounds for appeal include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improper admission or exclusion of evidence</li>
            <li>Misinterpretation of laws</li>
            <li>Procedural errors</li>
            <li>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Appellate Process</h3>
        <p>The appellate process in North Carolina typically follows these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notice of Appeal:</strong> Filed within a specified time after the judgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Record Preparation:</strong> Includes trial transcripts and relevant documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Brief Submission:</strong> Written arguments (briefs) outlining positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Oral Arguments:</strong> In some cases, oral presentations to clarify issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The court will affirm, reverse, remand, or modify the decision.</li>
        </ul>
